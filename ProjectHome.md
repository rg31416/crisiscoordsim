This simulation combines an agent-based model of a crisis response orgqanization with a discrete-event model of a crisis scenario. It simulates different coordination mechanisms between the agents for a particular crisis scenario of a crash including an explosion. The experiments enable comparing the relative performance of bottom-up and top-down coordination mechanisms in the crisis response scenario in terms of response effectiveness (vicims) and efficiency (response time) as well as coordination efficiency (where coordination cost is measured as number of messages exchanged between the agents).
